  Placement of Displacement
  <pre>
  How can the notion of home be articulated by the lived experiences of displacement
  and cultural identity, particularly in relation to intergenerational memory and 
  the evolving narratives of second-generation immigrants?
  </pre>
  <pre>
  As of 2025 we are facing major international conflicts, one of which right next door. 
  In December of 2024 6.2 millions of recorded Ukrainians found refuge in Europe, 
  out of which 85000 people are staying in Austria specifically. These happenings make 
  headlines in the current times, but displacement is as old as history. At the moment 
  of submission, the war is still ongoing, but even after a possible establishing of 
  peace some of the immigration will remain.

  Abstract
  
  This following proposal investigates the intersection of art, immigration, and 
  identity through personal narratives, framed within the contemporary context of dis-
  placement due to war and political upheaval. Drawing on my lived experience as a 
  second-generation immigrant and the accounts of those close to me affected by the 
  ongoing war in Ukraine, this proposal explores the notion of home and reflects on 
  cultural identity through articulating experiences of displacement, and examining the 
  outcomes of migration.

  Motivation
  
  Since the beginning of the war in 2022, I have found myself to be in a circumstance that 
  brought forth an urgency to be reflected upon. The circumstance reminds me of the stories 
  told to me by my grandmother, who witnessed the tragedies of the last century and lived 
  long enough to witness their continuation through today. As of today, I, too, am surroun-
  ded by stories of friends and family and witness their journeys of survival from my 
  protected position. 
    
    The confrontation with the war makes me turn to reflections of the displaced from 
  centuries before and to my own questionable identity of a Slav scattered in the west. How 
  did life end up so differently for me and them and how will it continue now that we are 
  both confronted by each other after displacement â€“ for some, through events long gone, and
  for some through events now escalating. How will our positions, that differ momentarily in
  residence status and the sensibility to the local language to say the least, differ also 
  in the course of the passage of time?

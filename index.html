  Placement of Displacement
  </p>
  <p>
  How can the notion of home be articulated by the lived experiences of displacement and cultural identity, particularly in relation to intergenerational memory and the evolving narratives of second-generation immigrants?
  </p>
  <p>
  As of 2025 we are facing major international conflicts, one
  of which right next door. In December of 2024 6.2 millions 
  of recorded Ukrainians found refuge in Europe, out of which 
  85000 people are staying in Austria specifically. These 
  happenings make headlines in the current times, but dis-
  placement is as old as history. At the moment of submission, 
  the war is still ongoing, but even after a possible establi-
  shing of peace some of the immigration will remain.
  </p>
  <p>
  Abstract
  </p>
  <p>
  This following proposal investigates the intersection of 
  art, immigration, and identity through personal narratives,
  framed within the contemporary context of displacement 
  due to war and political upheaval. Drawing on my lived 
  experience as a second-generation immigrant and the 
  accounts of those close to me affected by the ongoing war 
  in Ukraine, this proposal explores the notion of home and 
  reflects on cultural identity through articulating expe-
  riences of displacement, and examining the outcomes 
  of migration. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Motivation
  </p>
  <p>
  Since the beginning of the war in 2022, I have found 
  myself to be in a circumstance that brought forth an 
  urgency to be reflected upon. The circumstance reminds 
  me of the stories told to me by my grandmother, who wit-
  nessed the tragedies of the last century and lived long 
  enough to witness their continuation through today. As 
  of today, I, too, am surrounded by stories of friends 
  and family and witness their journeys of survival from 
  my protected position. 
  </p> 
  <p>
  The confrontation with the war makes me turn to reflec-
  tions of the displaced from centuries before and to my own 
  questionable identity of a Slav scattered in the west. How 
  did life end up so differently for me and them and how will 
  it continue now that we are both confronted by each other 
  after displacement – for some, through events long gone, and 
  for some through events now escalating. How will our positions, 
  that differ momentarily in residence status and the sensibi-
  lity to the local language to say the least, differ also in 
  the course of the passage of time? 
  </p>
  <p>
  Personal Interest
  </p>
  <p>
  I consider myself to be Austrian, Viennese. It is the 
  only feasible fact of identity that I can prove easily, 
  with no extra explanations needed. There, on my Austrian 
  passport it is marked under the birthplace. Occasionally
  I visit Austria, now that I moved to Belgium to finish 
  my studies. On my last visit I attended a concert picked 
  randomly at the Viennese Opera that would be performed 
  during my short stay.This piece turned out to be 
  Die letzten Tage der Menschlichkeit by Karl Kraus, out 
  of which carefully chosen parts have been performed by a 
  team of artists. Since the first lines of the narration 
  the relevance of the play has startled me deeply. In a 
  comedic light it touched upon the matters that are resur-
  facing now in my close environment. The acted out scenes 
  have been portrayed in an absurd, joking manner, radically 
  contrasting to the theme of the piece itself. War, death 
  and patriotism have been brought into a context of a dinner, 
  a chat between a mother and her child, a simple quarrel. 
  Not seldom myself have I been part of a dinner gathering 
  hosted by my parents with invited guests who stay in 
  Europe under the protection directive. There around the 
  table after glasses have been poured, the stories start 
  to flow and fates are being exchanged.

    -Привет, извини, разговаривала со Светой. Сегодня ночью 
    по Укр был кошмар. Нужно было узнать как у них. Мне тоже 
    не дали спок. поспать. Пришлось сидеть в коридоре. Погода 
    тоже не унимается. Сейчас на балконе 44 градуса, на земле 
    наверно 35. Арбуз оказался не вкусный, но не выбросила, 
    так как нет воды. Воду не могу принести т к жарко. 
    Просто круговорот. 
  </p>
  <p>
    -Hello, sorry, I was talking to Sveta. Tonight a night-
    mare settled across Ukraine. I had to make sure they are 
    ok. I also couldn’t sleep myself. Had to sit in the 
    corridor. The weather is a nuisance as well. Right now 
    we have 44 degrees on the balcony, probably 35 at ground 
    level. The watermelon turned out to be unripe, but I 
    didn’t throw it out, as I have no water. Cannot get it 
    from outside as it is too hot. A cycle, really. (Grandma)

  </p>
  <p>
    -In my Italian identification number they noted down as 
    place of birth the Russian federation. In my passport I 
    have written Kiev. Now I have no chances at all. (Father)

    -Но из хорошего: мой самолёт из Питера в Москву отменили, 
    так что мне торопиться некуда теперь. Запасусь едой, буду

  <p>
    -But there is good news too: my airplane from Petersburg 
    to Moscow got cancelled, so I don’t have to rush now. I 
    will arm myself with food and wait in the queue.

  Julia, the neighbor of my parents and a frequent invitee, 
  is one of those guests. She, though still burdened with a 
  great deal of losses, considers herself to be one of the 
  lucky ones. She arrived to Germany with her immediate family 
  still intact – her children and her husband. Her nephew, 
  the son of her brother, died in war reaching no more than 
  20 years of age. They failed to find a way to transport him 
  out of Ukraine and he was conscripted.
  </p>
  <p>
  Now Julia works at the hotel in the village where she 
  lives, though in Ukraine before she possessed an education 
  in law. She never complains and to the tiny village where 
  her family now found a refuge she only has warm words to 
  offer. In the community of this village, no politically 
  charged arguments ever resurface and the quarrel is bound 
  to trash disposal and barbecue park schedule. On one of 
  these barbecues that I attended, Julia shared with me how 
  the location reminds her of Crimea, her most favorite city 
  from the ones she has seen and a place where she ideally 
  wanted to live in. Realistically though, she was living 
  in an industrial city in the east of Ukraine that was bombed 
  and rebuild, then bombed again. Nevertheless, there, she was 
  a citizen belonging in every sense of the meaning and that 
  was what mattered most.

  On Paradise before the Paradise
  </p>
  <p>
  In the second part of Lost in Translation, Life in a 
  New Language Eva Hoffman describes how her mind attached 
  the place she left to a never ending feeling of tesknota, 
  or nostalgia. The descriptions of her past Eva Hoffman 
  keeps in a tone that is not scarce on detailed, pictorial 
  language. She is conscious of it and addresses it through-
  out the book:
  </p>
  <p>
    -Of course, fate doesn’t play such premonitory games, 
    but memory can perform retrospective maneuvers to 
    compensate for fate. Loss is a magical preservative. 
    Time stops at the point of severance, and no subsequent 
    impressions muddy the picture you have in mind. The 
    house, the garden, the country you have lost remain 
    forever as you remember them. Nostalgia — that most 
    lyrical of feelings — crystallizes around these images 
    like amber. Arrested within it, the house, the past, 
    is clear, vivid, made more beautiful by the medium 
    in which it is held and by its stillness.
  </p>
  <p>
  The longer one stays in immigration or exile, the stiller 
  the images become. The passage of time might have the 
  ability to still memories, but it happens gradually and 
  unnoticed. For newcomers the transition is clear and well 
  defined – often the crossing of the geographical border 
  itself, the displacement, transportation, the first step 
  into the new place. The instant responsibility of distancing, 
  if not forgetting, is separating life in past and present 
  with almost unnatural precision. After all, how would 
  adaptation to the new environment be possible otherwise? 
  At the beginning of the chapter Exile, Eva Hoffman makes 
  a note on this exact preciseness of transition, closing 
  off the first chapter of her autobiography – Paradise:
  </p>
  <p>
    -From now on, my life will be divided into two parts, with 
    the line drawn by that train.
  </p>
  <p>
  Life occurring after the displacement will forever be a 
  form of déjà vu. Actions will happen paired with internal 
  comparison to the way they happened before. This duality 
  is a fruitful environment for artistic and intellectual 
  pursuits, but results in an inextinguishable dissatisfaction, 
  as described in Reflections on Exile by Edward Said:
  </p>
  <p>
    -Exile is never the state of being satisfied, placid, or 
    secure. Exile, in the words of Wallace Stevens, is “a mind
    of winter” in which the pathos of summer and autumn as much 
    as the potential of spring are nearby but unobtainable.
  </p>
  <p>
  Second Generation
  </p>
  <p>
  Within the circumstance of an immigrant who arrived at 
  a young age or the children of the first generation an array 
  of additional specifics come into play. The first and utmost, 
  is the question of national identity. Nationalism is of 
  highest relevance to the person in exile, as it is a unit of 
  identification with components such as language, customs, 
  ethnicity and what not. Nationalism can birth exile and 
  nationalism can be activated by exile.
  </p>
  <p>
  In difference to the newcomers of the first generation, the 
  second generation is entering the new lands with significant 
  benefits. They are accustomed to the local language and are 
  less incapacitated by what happened before, the stilled 
  images before displacement. These benefits allow for an 
  easier integration but bestow upon the new generation a 
  burden of rarely discussed responsibility. This responsi-
  bility can be summarized as an expectation of assimilation, 
  both by parents and by the local environment. In their demand 
  for the achievement of this impossible deed they always mean 
  well. The desire for improvement of one’s fate is impatient 
  and it comes down to – I was this so I am here and I was this 
  so you are here.
  </p>
  <p>
  The 26th of November is a very special day, marked as the 
  day my father left his hometown to head towards the west. 
  He left his hometown a few days after turning 20, reaching 
  the last city of the vast soviet territory by train and then 
  crossing over to Austria by foot, trying to be unseen by 
  border control till he reached the Austrian land. To this 
  day, while I live separately from my parents, every year I 
  receive a message on this date with the epic story of my 
  father´s transit:
  </p>
  <p>
    -Ровно сегодня ночью, 34 года назад, я перешёл границу 
    Австрии и сдался.
  </p>
  <p>  
    -This night exactly, 34 years ago, I crossed the Austrian 
    border and surrendered myself.
  </p>
  <p>
  The need for assimilation has also several internal factors 
  of motivation. If for the first generation there is home and 
  displacement, for the second generation the home is displace-
  ment. The identification with the original home of the parents 
  becomes morally questionable partly due to the abovementioned 
  responsibility of assimilation, which is impossible with a 
  sentiment of another home, and partly due to the lack of 
  living in the cultural setting of the place of origin, which 
  results in the loss of important components of identification.
  </p>
  <p>
  Case Study: Placement of Displacement through Transfer
  </p>
  <p>
  For some time now my artistic interest lies in making 
  monotypes - specifically in the act of transfer drawing. 
  I find two distinctive qualities of this technique of great 
  relevance to my area of research:
  </p>
  <p>
  1.	When using a medium that leaves a mark to produce a 
  drawing on the back of a carrier (or with a sheet of paper, 
  canvas in between), you end up with a drawing made with a 
  direct approach and a transfer drawing made indirectly through 
  a contact with a panel.
  2.	When using a medium that does not leave any marks (the 
  handle of a brush or the other end of a pencil), you end 
  up with an unpredictable outcome of a transfer, similar 
  to the technique of blind drawing.
  </p>
  <p>
  In the influence of both of these qualities on the process 
  of making, I see a similarity with the stillness of the 
  memories the way described by Hoffman. The transfer drawing 
  does not happen directly by the maker’s hand, but imprints 
  itself through an inked panel, somewhat unpredictably. As a 
  parody on the journey of displacement, the panel too 
  separates the act of drawing – remembering the reference – 
  into what you see and know in the moment and a sharp still 
  trace of it. In this sense it has the potential to become 
  this medium that crystallizes the places we leave or the 
  places our eyes leave. The imprint thus is both the memory 
  of the place but also its denial, a testament to our 
  displacement, almost its negation. It is a reminder that 
  we left and a source of tesknota.
  </p>
  <p>
  Objectives
  </p>
  <p>
  With this outlook, I propose to investigate displacement and 
  what it entails – exile, immigration, the specific case of 
  the second generation, transition and borders. My scope of 
  reference would be narratives from people close to me affected 
  by the war, both Ukrainians and Russians, as well as the 
  delicate and overlooked position of the second generation 
  immigrants, like the children of the current newcomers who will 
  face a set of peculiarities different from their parents.
  </p>
  <p>
  I subscribe by the believe that displacement and loss of 
  home result in an especially strong desire of reformulation 
  of that longing into a maker’s outlet – agreed upon both by 
  Edward Said and Weihsin Gui, who draws a parallel between 
  the nature of aesthetics and migration in his essay 
  The Migrant Longing for Form:
  </p>
  <p>
    -The second way of understanding the migrant longing for 
    form is to consider how the longing for form itself is 
    migrant, is itself a form of movement, displaced and 
    capable of displacing other ideas and entities from their 
    settled positions in our lived experiences and our know-
    ledge structures, and this displacement asks us to consider 
    aesthetics alongside the ethics and politics of the 
    social formations and cultural objects we study.
  </p>
  <p>
  To refer back to my initial research question of articula-
  tion of home I would like to delve into the specifics of 
  this multifaceted longing through both a practice based 
  approach (stemming from my previous curriculum as a simple 
  hands-on artist), fulfilling so to say this need of making 
  as a second generation immigrant, and through documentation 
  of insight shared with me by newcomers (friends, family and 
  acquaintances) around Europe.

  The postion of eternal sadness (?)
  </p>
  <p>
  After almost five years in Belgium, this past New Year’s Eve I returned to my family to celebrate the arrival of 2025. The word returning here is strictly figurative, as I have never been in their new home and the city they moved to. The city is very small and requires multiple zoom-ins to be able to see it on Google Maps.
  </p>
  <p>
  It was the first New Year celebration that I spent with my parents since the turn of 2020. Since then a solid number of global events transpired – covid and the war in Ukraine to name the most relevant to me. Though my parents have changed their domicile a number of times during this turbulent moment, their way of welcoming the coming year did not really change. The dishes came from the same well-loved menu formed by personal and Soviet customs with only maybe the addition of a cold Korean salad (that I still suspect is more Russian than anything Korean). 
  </p>
  <p>
  Around the beginning of the dinner the first fireworks light up the sky and we attribute them to the Chinese community, estimating the time difference between Germany and China. Later at ten in the evening follow the Russians and the Ukrainians an hour after that. The firework schedule summarizes effectively the main groups of inhabitants in Hoppstädten-Weiersbach, guided there by the affordability of the housing.
  </p>
  <p>
  Half an hour before the Ukrainian New Year, while I am on the phone with my grandmother in the bedroom of my parents further from the noise of the kitchen, my ears fill up with an all-consuming repertoire of Soviet hits from its later era. Our neighbours came to our apartment door with a music box on blast, in festive spirit. Sadly, I do not remember the exact song, but I am pretty convinced it is something from Victor Saltykov.
  </p>
  <p>
  This moment remained quite memorable to me in many aspects. One of them is the contrast of feelings that I experienced as both a participant and observer of the celebration. What to my senses seemed like a positively charged loud evening, stroke me emotionally as a gathering laced with a deep underlying sadness. Why would I be afflicted with such a particular impression of my surroundings both at the time of the event and during my reminiscence of it after? 
  </p>
  <p>
  At the time I have been reading through Edward Said´s Reflections on Exile and somewhat agreeing with his way of writing about such a delicate topic as displacement. To him writing this essay has been deeply personal – reflecting on his own life in exile and drawing parallels between literary works that he admired and the people who have written them. It is not difficult to pick up the utterly pessimistic tone throughout the text; Said is daring in formulating a very bleak outlook on the fates of exiles and questioning any desire to romanticize their condition. At times he is carried away into describing flaws in characters of the displaced, no doubt revealing his personal perception of himself among anything else. While I have never faced exile, I have, as a child of immigrants and someone who lost many homes in my parent´s search for stability, echoed some of his contemplations:
  </p>
  <p>
    -Exiles look at non-exiles with resentment. They belong in their surroundings, you feel, whereas an exile is always out of place. What is it like to be born in a place, to stay and live there, to know that you are of it, more or less forever?
  </p>
  <p>
  This unquenchable sadness Said bases partly upon the need of the preservation of the past, that we all carry, but that is understandably more complicated in the case of the displaced. It is also simultaneously much more sought after, as all the differences that come with the new environment function also as constant reminders.
  </p>
  <p>
  The importance of the preservation of the past Said takes from The Need for Roots, written by Simone Weil in 1943. To give a brief summary of The Need for Roots – it has been written as a suggestion to reshape France after its occupation by Germany into a place that provides a fruitful future to its citizens. The book starts with Weil’s description of 15 immediate needs for the human soul, with the last being also the most important – the need for rootedness. The text is full of detailed advice and criticisms on various specific areas that are generally outside of an immediate relevance to me, like the state of Christianity and the understandable but rather distant to me preoccupation with France’s historical setbacks.
  </p>
  <p>
  When searching for relevant literature for the formulation of my research question I have, even if hesitantly at first, integrated Weil´s concept of uprootedness as one of many possible lines of thought into the inquiry – How can the notion of home be articulated by the lived experiences of displacement and cultural identity? Although I have obviously never projected to formulate a precise answer to this question, much rather document and gather a collection of narratives without a forceful framing, I have nevertheless connected deeply to the compact definition that feels very much like a starting point of bringing the notion of home into words:
  </p>
  <p>
    -To be rooted is perhaps the most important and least recognized need of the human soul. It is one of the hardest to define. A human being has roots by virtue of his real, active and natural participation in the life of a community which preserves in living shape certain particular treasures of the past and certain particular expectations for the future. This participation is a natural one, in the sense that it is automatically brought about by place, conditions of birth, profession and social surroundings.
  </p>
  <p>
  To my inner projection of sorrow upon my family´s celebration of the new year and to Edward Said´s self-implicating pessimism The Need for Roots provides a justification of sadness which, at times, can be abrasive and victimizing. It is somewhat a consolation to read that what you are lacking is a need of the highest importance and that your happiness is, at least in this instance, outside of your control:
  </p>
  <p>
    -Weil exposes us anew to that whole complex of pressures and constraints that lie at the center of the exile’s predicament, which, as I have suggested, is as close as we come in the modern era to tragedy.
  </p>
  <p>
  The pirozhki, borsh, manti, the cholodec and olivier, all taken out of their origin and united lovingly upon a table, bring me a sense of bitter appreciation amidst a tiny German city that does not even have a grocery store. They make me think that the loud disruptive music of our neighbours seems to be this way perhaps only compared to the silence of the surrounding forests that separate us from bigger cities or the origin of my mother´s manti or our neighbours´ previous celebrations in Ukraine. They make me also think of the teenage children of our neighbours, who are isolated in this empty city, just a bit too old to comfortably learn the local language and celebrate with youngsters of their own age group. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The concept of uprootedness positions the preservation of the natural past both individually and collectively as a necessary foundation for the sense of belonging in your surroundings and a most fruitful base for growth. Does the loss of the natural environment result in the loss of home?

  Placement of Displacement
  <pre>
  How can the notion of home be articulated by the lived experiences of displacement
  and cultural identity, particularly in relation to intergenerational memory and 
  the evolving narratives of second-generation immigrants?
  </pre>
  <pre>
  As of 2025 we are facing major international conflicts, one of which right next door. 
  In December of 2024 6.2 millions of recorded Ukrainians found refuge in Europe, 
  out of which 85000 people are staying in Austria specifically. These happenings make 
  headlines in the current times, but displacement is as old as history. At the moment 
  of submission, the war is still ongoing, but even after a possible establishing of 
  peace some of the immigration will remain.

  Abstract
  
  This following proposal investigates the intersection of art, immigration, and 
  identity through personal narratives, framed within the contemporary context of dis-
  placement due to war and political upheaval. Drawing on my lived experience as a 
  second-generation immigrant and the accounts of those close to me affected by the 
  ongoing war in Ukraine, this proposal explores the notion of home and reflects on 
  cultural identity through articulating experiences of displacement, and examining 
  the outcomes of migration.

  Motivation
  
  Since the beginning of the war in 2022, I have found myself to be in a circumstance 
  that brought forth an urgency to be reflected upon. The circumstance reminds me of 
  the stories told to me by my grandmother, who witnessed the tragedies of the last 
  century and lived long enough to witness their continuation through today. As of 
  today, I, too, am surrounded by stories of friends and family and witness their jour-
  neys of survival from my protected position. 
    
    The confrontation with the war makes me turn to reflections of the displaced from 
  centuries before and to my own questionable identity of a Slav scattered in the west.
  How did life end up so differently for me and them and how will it continue now that 
  we are both confronted by each other after displacement – for some, through events 
  long gone, and for some through events now escalating. How will our positions, that 
  differ momentarily in residence status and the sensibility to the local language to 
  say the least, differ also in the course of the passage of time?

  Personal Interest
  
  I consider myself to be Austrian, Viennese. It is the only feasible fact of identity 
  that I can prove easily, with no extra explanations needed. There, on my Austrian 
  passport it is marked under the birthplace. Occasionally I visit Austria, now that I 
  moved to Belgium to finish my studies. On my last visit I attended a concert picked 
  randomly at the Viennese Opera that would be performed during my short stay. This 
  piece turned out to be Die letzten Tage der Menschlichkeit by Karl Kraus, out of which 
  carefully chosen parts have been performed by a team of artists. Since the first lines
  of the narration the relevance of the play has startled me deeply. In a comedic light 
  it touched upon the matters that are resurfacing now in my close environment. The acted
  out scenes have been portrayed in an absurd, joking manner, radically contrasting to the 
  theme of the piece itself. War, death and patriotism have been brought into a context of
  a dinner, a chat between a mother and her child, a simple quarrel. Not seldom myself 
  have I been part of a dinner gathering hosted by my parents with invited guests who stay
  in Europe under the protection directive. There around the table after glasses have been
  poured, the stories start to flow and fates are being exchanged.
  
    -Привет, извини, разговаривала со Светой. Сегодня ночью по Укр был кошмар. Нужно было
    узнать как у них. Мне тоже не дали спок. поспать. Пришлось сидеть в коридоре. Погода 
    тоже не унимается. Сейчас на балконе 44 градуса, на земле наверно 35. Арбуз оказался 
    не вкусный, но не выбросила, так как нет воды. Воду не могу принести т к жарко.
    Просто круговорот. 

    -Hello, sorry, I was talking to Sveta. Tonight a nightmare settled across Ukraine. I 
    had to make sure they are ok. I also couldn’t sleep myself. Had to sit in the corridor. 
    The weather is a nuisance as well. Right now we have 44 degrees on the balcony, probably 
    35 at ground level. The watermelon turned out to be unripe, but I didn’t throw it out, 
    as I have no water. Cannot get it from outside as it is too hot. A cycle, really. (Grandma)

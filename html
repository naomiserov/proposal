  Placement of Displacement
  <pre>
  How can the notion of home be articulated by the lived experiences of displacement and cultural identity, particularly in relation to intergenerational memory and the evolving narratives of second-generation immigrants?
As of 2025 we are facing major international conflicts, one of which right next door. In December of 2024 6.2 millions of recorded Ukrainians found refuge in Europe, out of which 85000 people are staying in Austria specifically. These happenings make headlines in the current times, but displacement is as old as history. At the moment of submission, the war is still ongoing, but even after a possible establishing of peace some of the immigration will remain.
